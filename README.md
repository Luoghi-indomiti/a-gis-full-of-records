# a-gis-full-of-records

Code sprint project to test [OGC API Records Part 1 draft specification](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-004.html)

OGC API - Records is a multi-part draft specification that offers the capability to create, modify, and query metadata on the Web. The draft specification enables the discovery of geospatial resources by standardizing the way collections of descriptive information about the resources (metadata) are exposed. The draft specification also enables the discovery and sharing of related resources that may be referenced from geospatial resources or their metadata by standardizing the way all kinds of records are exposed and managed. Part 1 will cover read-only access to records and simple query capabilities. Additional capabilities that address specific needs will be specified in additional parts. Capabilities for richer queries or to create, update or delete records will be specified in additional parts.
